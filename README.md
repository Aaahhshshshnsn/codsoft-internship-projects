## Introduction
This repository contains the Java tasks completed as part of the Codsoft internship program. Each task focuses on different concepts and problem-solving techniques in Java. Feel free to explore, run, and enhance the code according to your needs.

## Prerequisites
Before running the projects and assignments, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
- Basic understanding of Java programming concepts

## Folder Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

```
├── Task 1 - <Task Name>
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src
│   │   └── Main.java
├── Task 2 - <Task Name>
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src
│   │   └── Main.java
├── Task 3 - <Task Name>
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src
│   │   └── Main.java
├── Task 4 - <Task Name>
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src
│   │   └── Main.java
└── ...
```

- Each task is organized into separate folders.
- Each folder includes a `README.md` explaining the problem statement, approach, and outputs.
- `src` folder contains the `.java` files for the implementation.

## Tasks Overview
Below is a brief description of the tasks:

1. **Task 1: Simple Banking Application**
   - Create a basic banking system where users can deposit, withdraw, and view their balance.
   
2. **Task 2: Employee Management System**
   - Implement an Employee Management System to add, remove, and search employees using their IDs.
   
3. **Task 3: Calculator Application**
   - Develop a console-based calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations.
   
4. **Task 4: Student Information System**
   - Create a program that maintains student records and provides functions to add, view, and update data.

5. **Task 5: String Manipulation Program**
   - Perform various string operations such as reverse, concatenation, and substring.

> Note: More tasks will be added as the internship progresses.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Codsoft-Java-Internship.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired task folder:
   ```bash
   cd Task\ 1\ -\ Simple\ Banking\ Application
   ```

3. Compile the Java program:
   ```bash
   javac src/Main.java
   ```

4. Run the compiled Java program:
   ```bash
   java -cp src Main
   ```

> Alternatively, you can open the project in your preferred IDE and run the `Main.java` file.
